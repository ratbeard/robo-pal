This little guy turns a text file of questions into mp3 files where a robot
will read the question and then wait a specified amount of time so you can
vocalize the answer.  Add it to iTunes and sync to your phone.  Great for
practicing for interviews, and things! 

Requires `ffmpeg`

Generates mp3s inside the `./audio` directory:

	./generate
